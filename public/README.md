# React Portals Demo
## public folder

For this example, I changed the file _index.html_, I added a new div with an specific id (`id=modals`), this is the div where the components will render when we call the Portal to this specific id.

So it doesn't matter how deep is the Modal, on the React app, we will say to Portal to render any modal inside of the div with the `id=modals`
